    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>I am a gradute of Abia State Univeristy and I studied Electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years in school <br>
    but I had a certain love for web deveopment, so in 2022, i enrolled for a web programming class while my school Was <br>
    on strike. I wasn't able to complete the class then because the strike was short-lived, so after my 5 years in school <br>
    i went back and completed the class and now I'm a good website programmer all thanks to God and my tutor, Samkacy.</p> <hr>
